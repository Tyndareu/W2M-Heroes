# W2M

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.3.

## Development server

Run `npm start` to run both the backend and frontend servers concurrently.

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Running servers separately

If you prefer, you can run the servers in separate terminals:

- For the backend server, run `npm run backend`.
- For the frontend dev server, run `ng serve`.
